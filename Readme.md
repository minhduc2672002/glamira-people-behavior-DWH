## 1.Introduction
In this project, we'll use dbt (Data Build Tool) and SQL on Google BigQuery for data transformation. Our goal is to convert raw data into a more accessible format for extracting insights. dbt, an open-source tool, will help us effectively transform data in our warehouses. We'll use SQL for data management and Google BigQuery, a fully-managed, serverless data warehouse, for super-fast SQL queries.

### Explain:
- Data stored in Mongodb is extracted and loaded into DataLake (Google Cloud Storage).
- Use Cloud Functions to trigger data into BigQuery whenever data arrives in GCS.
- Use DBT to transform and model data into a data warehouse layer.
